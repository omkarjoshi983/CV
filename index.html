            <h3>Portfolio Management</h3>
            <p>In my applied research course work at the University of Canterbury, I along with three other classmates created a portfolio consisting of equities from NZX 50 and a risk-free asset.
              We used modern portfolio theory to construct a random portfolio and optimal portfolio for a client based on the risk appetite.
              We monitored and calculated returns on the portfolio. The returns were not in line with our expected returns and the worst-case scenarios and to analyze these diﬀerences further investigation was performed.
              These investigations showed that the returns were not up to the mark due to external factors and some of which were unforeseen. We scored A- grade for our report, presentations, and the analysis of portfolio underperformance.

            <h3>Bankruptcy Analysis</h3>
            <p>At the University of Canterbury, I did an individual project to identify and analyze the financial distress of the companies leading to bankruptcy.
              I selected companies from the Manufacturing and Retail industries from the year 2000 to 2012.
              Multivariate Discriminant Analysis was used in Excel with 6 variables considered as value-adding towards the result. Three models were built using diﬀerent variables to test the suitability of variables and their impact on the Z score.
              All models were tested using a random sample and Holdout sample.
              These models were tested for accuracy two years before bankruptcy and further analysis was not possible due to lack of data. For this report, I secured an A- grade.
